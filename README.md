The code contains some statistics about the Chinese language, as well as some symbolic and semantic equivalencies that are particularly interesting, that Claude Opus 4.5 was able to pull out of the Unicode standard Unihan database and an IDS file it found on Github.

This is a fascinating, structured look into the composition of ideograms in the Chinese language - and the hidden connotations that follow. This also happens to be a playable game, with some quirks. Not all Chinese characters are included in the game for complexity or rendering reasons. Some symbols or radicals you will find appear as something else when scored - this is a kind of semantic equivalency that occurs in symbolic compression in the Chinese written tradition. Further, some combinations of radicals you may find to be able to be scored twice. This may be due to said semantic equivalence between different radicals/symbols, or because of an equivalence between simplified/traditional forms of the symbol.
